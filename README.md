## Response models use data mining to find similarities between responders from previous marketing campaigns to predict who is likely or not likely to respond to a future campaign. The model is then scored against the prospects of the new campaign and a marketer can choose to mail only those people that are most likely to purchase. This increases conversions and decreases costs by only mailing to those most likely to respond.
